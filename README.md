# MobileSink-PathPlanning-WSN

**Dynamic Mobile Sink Path Planning for Unsynchronized Data Collection in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks**

---

## üìå **Abstract**

Heterogeneous sensors generate data following diverse distributions in HWSNs. Mobile sinks (MSs) are commonly used to gather this data. Traditional methods often assume synchronized data generation, where all sensors produce data simultaneously and focus on delay constraints. However, real-world monitoring applications often have sensors generating data independently.

This project addresses **unsynchronized data collection** by modeling the path planning problem as a **Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW)**. We propose a **hybrid approach** combining **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** with **Beam Search** to minimize sink travel time while reducing travel costs and energy constraints.
